# About

This package brings an easy way to find all references to a GameObject and its components in a given scene.

# How to use

In the Window tab you can find a new option that says "Find GameObject References". Uppon clicking, a pop up window will open. 
There, you can select or drag and drop a GameObject from your scene and press "Find References". A list of all references found will then be shown.\
The information is formatted as follows:

* GameObject with references' name 1
  * Component's name 1 -> Field's name (Type of field)
 
* GameObject with references' name 2
  * Component's name 1 -> Field's name (Type of field)
  * Component's name 2 -> Field's name (Type of field)

If no references have been found it will say so.
